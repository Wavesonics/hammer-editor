## [3.9.0] - 2026-8-16

New features
- Export only the scenes you choose, in every export format
- Private web shares can be limited to a selection of scenes
- Encyclopedia entry names and aliases feed the spell check dictionary, so your invented names stop being flagged as misspelled. Controllable globally, per project, and per entry
- Scenes now connect to every kind of Encyclopedia entry, not just People and Places
- Drag the editor's edge to set how wide it gets on large screens
- Server: search the Allowed Users list by email

Improvements
- Logging in to a new server asks whether to merge or replace, and only asks when local work is actually at stake
- Published stories and every export now lay prose out the way the editor shows it, line for line
- A scene opens for typing immediately instead of waiting for spell check to finish
- Scene tree nesting is easier to read
- Save all moved from Ctrl+Alt+S to Ctrl+Shift+S, so AltGr layouts keep their characters
- Desktop (Linux): runs natively on Wayland instead of being forced through XWayland
- Web: the editorial review dialog's scene list uses the full height of the window
- Italian translation added, and translations updated for German, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), and Ukrainian
- Server: Argon2 password hashing no longer loads a native library, which fixes signup and login on hosts that mount the data volume noexec

Fixes
- Client: scenes in a folder holding exactly ten items could go blank and export empty
- Client: sync could fail when a folder crossed a ten-item boundary
- Client: unsaved edits survive a device rotation on Android
- Client: AltGr chords no longer close the app on Turkish, German, and Polish layouts
- Client: crash when closing a project with the scene metadata panel open
- Sync: renaming a project onto the name of one you had deleted
- Sync: project settings could be wiped when a project moved to a different server
- Sync: a local project sharing a name with a server project could leave a duplicate behind
- Server: sync could hang indefinitely on hosts with a shallow entropy pool
- Server: concurrent sync sessions could be handed colliding sync ids
- Server: API errors returned a 500 instead of falling back to English when a translation was missing
- Web: Allowed Users paging could repeat and skip entries


## [3.8.2] - 2026-8-11

New features
- Web: public sign-up page, so an allowed user can create an account without installing the app
- Server: the Allowed Users list is now always enforced; the old whitelist toggle is gone

Improvements
- Server: web sign-ins are now recorded in the security audit trail, alongside app sign-ins
- Server: admin instance messages render as Markdown, so links, emphasis, and lists work in them
- About: Dark Rock Studios attribution moved into its own "Studio" section with a full-screen Cairn overlay
- Desktop: dropped the JetBrains Runtime requirement; builds run on stock Temurin OpenJDK now
- Translations updated for German, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), and Ukrainian

Fixes

- Desktop (Linux/Snap): fixed a crash on launch


## [3.8.1] - 2026-8-8

Improvements
- Desktop window decoration migrated to the Nucleus TAO backend
- Server: trustProxyForwarding option reads real client IPs from X-Forwarded-* headers when running behind a reverse proxy, so the login rate limiter, login audit trail, and story reader counts reflect actual clients instead of the proxy
- Translations updated for German, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), and Ukrainian
- Rendered stories now use real book typography: indented lists, a centered scene-break ornament, tinted blockquotes, and deliberate blank-line spacing between paragraphs

Fixes
- Client: text editor no longer drops block structure (horizontal rules, images, code fences) when a scene loads
- Client: font size changes no longer flatten list and blockquote indents
- Client: typed text after a size change could lose the paragraph's body style
- Client: F3 and Ctrl+Alt+S sync shortcuts work from anywhere in the project window
- Client: tag suggestion chips could add the typed prefix instead of the selected tag
- Sync: projects with a stale cached server id could get stuck failing "410 Gone" instead of recreating
- Web: ~~strikethrough~~ rendered as literal tildes instead of struck-through text


## [3.8.0] - 2026-8-4

https://hammer.ink/blog/news/hammer-3-8-0

- Import and export documents as HTML, alongside Markdown

- Scene drag and drop stays accurate while the list autoscrolls
- Chapter detection on Markdown import understands Setext-style and bold titles
- Visible scrollbars on scrolling screens, and scroll-away footers float over their lists
- Translations updated for German, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), and Ukrainian
- Server: the setup page can create the initial admin account
- Server: a self-hosted server not serving HTTPS now reports a clear error instead of "Network error"
- Server: smaller Docker image
- Web: error responses show a toast instead of failing silently

### Fixes

- Client: importing a very large story no longer freezes the app
- Client: scene drag could grab the wrong row
- Client: literal `**` and `_` left around emphasis imported from RTF

- Client: a number of text editor crashes around undo, paste, and joined paragraphs
