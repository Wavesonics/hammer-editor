## Running the Desktop app

`gradlew run`

## Running Tests

Our mocking library `mockk` does not yet support Kotlin/Native, thus we need to choose one of the **JVM** targets to
write the tests for. We chose desktop:

`gradlew desktopTest`

And for the Server:

`gradlew server:test`

#### Checking code coverage

`gradlew koverMergedHtmlReport`

The results of which will be here:
[Code Coverage Report](./build/reports/kover/merged/html/index.html)

## Writing Tests

### `Common` Module Tests:

Most tests live in the `desktopTest` source set, but a few do live in `commonTest`

#### Testing utilities:

`BaseTest` sets you up for injecting wit Koin and dealing with coroutines for testing.

`TestProjectUtils.kt` has functions for generating test data.

### `ComposeUI` Module Tests:

Again, most tests live in the `desktopTest` source set, but a few live in `commonTest`

testing: [Compose Test Cheatsheet](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/ui/test/package-summary)

## Client Development

### Client Architecture

![Client Architecture Layers](readme/client-architecture-layers.png)

### Coroutines

### Repository Layer

Repositories will need to declare their own coroutine scope, there is no common base class to do so.
```kotlin
	// The various dispatcher can be injected as such
	private val mainDispatcher by injectMainDispatcher()
	private val defaultDispatcher by injectDefaultDispatcher()
	private val ioDispatcher by injectIoDispatcher()
```

#### Component layer
Component base class `ComponentBase` has a coroutine scope defined already: `scope`

This scope will be canceled for you when the component is destroyed.

You can inject the various contexts as such:
```kotlin
	private val mainDispatcher by injectMainDispatcher()
	private val defaultDispatcher by injectDefaultDispatcher()
	private val ioDispatcher by injectIoDispatcher()

	// `scope` here is from the `ComponentBase` parent class
	scope.launch {
        // Scope uses the default dispatcher, so make sure to switch contexts when necessary
        withContext(mainDispatcher) {
			// Make sure you update all of your state variables on the main thread
		}
	}
```

#### UI Layer: Compose
```kotlin
	// Define your own, or use scope hoisting to a parent Composable
	val scope = rememberCoroutineScope()

	// inject which ever dispatcher you need
	val mainDispatcher = rememberMainDispatcher()
	val defaultDispatcher = rememberDefaultDispatcher()
	val ioDispatcher = rememberIoDispatcher()
	
	scope.launch(defaultDispatcher) { 
		// Do stuff in background
		withContext(mainDispatcher) {
			// Back on main thread
		}
	}
```
