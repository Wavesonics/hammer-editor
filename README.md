A simple tool for building stories.

## Multi-platform

This app is where ever you are. Your phone, tablet, desktop, laptop, this program can be installed and run, not simply a
website-in-a-box, but instead using native client side technologies to provide the best experience possible.

### Initial support will be for:
- ![badge-platform-windows]
- ![badge-platform-android] (*Phone & Tablet*)

### Will add support for more platforms in the future:
- ![badge-platform-linux]
- ![badge-platform-macos]
- ![badge-platform-ios]

## Offline first
I was frustrated with most of the story writing software I was finding as they were using web technologies (aka: Web
Page in a box) which always seems to run into problems while being used offline for long periods of time.

## Transparent Data

Your data is yours. It's not stored in the cloud, or some opaque database. It is stored in simple, human readable files,
just using files and folders to define the project structure. You can open your OSes file browser and take a look for
your self. If this program went away today you would be able to easily interact with your data.
