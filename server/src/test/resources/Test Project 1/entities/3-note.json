Cohen reads Alice as a roman Ã  clef populated with real figures from Carroll's life. Alice is based on Alice Liddell; the Dodo is Carroll; Wonderland is Oxford; even the Mad Tea Party, according to Cohen, is a send-up of Alice's own birthday party.[41] The critic Jan Susina rejects Cohen's account, arguing that Alice the character bears a tenuous relationship with Alice Liddell.\n\nBeyond its refashioning of Carroll's everyday life, Cohen argues, Alice critiques Victorian ideals of childhood. It is an account of \"the child's plight in Victorian upper-class society\" in which Alice's mistreatment by the creatures of Wonderland reflects Carroll's own mistreatment by older people as a child.",
